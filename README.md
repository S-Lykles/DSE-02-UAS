"MULTI-MISSION MODULAR UAS FOR DISASTER RELIEF"

Project Objective: Design of a multi-mission, modular, Vertical Take of and Landing
(VTOL) Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) configuration which can: 1) Take off and land
vertically from the deck of a ship in high-winds and gusty conditions. 2) Cruise to and from
the site of a disaster. 3) Serve as a long-endurance communications relay, OR land vertically
to deliver relief supplies. 4) Satisfy the requirements of both the long-endurance and
supplies-delivery missions, the vehicle may be modified using a system of modular add-ons.
